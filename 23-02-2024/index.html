    <h1>WEEKLY REVIEW</h1>


    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>
      This week, I was busy with an HTML and CSS test, as well as an English
      class.
    </p>

    <h2>Body</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>
      I was creating the framework website using HTML and CSS when I encountered
      a challenge of linking my navbar to the current window. I managed to
      resolve it by adding IDs to each navbar I am linking to. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I attended the English class where I was busy with oral exercises,
      including presenting my favorite poem by Maya Angelou, 'STILL I RISE.' My
      presentation went well as I answered all the questions asked by my English
      teacher and fellow students.
    </p>


    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>I will continue working on a framework website test.</p>
